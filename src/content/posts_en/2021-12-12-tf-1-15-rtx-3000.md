Hello. This time I'll note how to use TensorFlow 1.15 and TensorBoard with GPUs like RTX 3090 and 3080.

To use 3000 series GPUs with TensorFlow officially distributed, you need to upgrade to version 2.
Since TensorFlow has API specification changes between version 1 and 2, running version 1 code is difficult.

So instead of using the officially distributed version, we'll use the one distributed by NVIDIA.

```bash
pip install nvidia-pyindex
pip install nvidia-tensorflow
pip uninstall tensorboard
pip install nvidia-tensorboard
```

Requirements:

- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- Nvidia Driver r455
- Python 3.8
- pip 19.0 or later

Now you can use TensorFlow==1.15 & TensorBoard even with RTX 3090!
